[Intro]
La-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
It's eight o'clock in the morning, now I'm entering my bed
Had a few dreams about you, I can't tell you what we did
I expected to see you on your morning run again
I know I shouldn't be watching 'cause every time I feel the pain

[Refrain]
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la

[Verse 2]
You told me it wasn't over and that we'd be together soon
But was this before or after you told me to leave your room?
I used to think we'd make it far, it turned out that we are
It's such a shame that we weren't the same at all

[Refrain]
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la
